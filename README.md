1. IMAGE DISPLAY - This was much of a struggle as I initially had problems when creating a gallery in the second week and only realised towards the end why my background image kept moving to the side instead of centralizing.
2. RENDERING - Normally , this wouldn't be a problem but this time it wouldn't work.
3. STRETCH STORIES - I accomplished two stretch stories, both relating to the APIs. I managed to use unsplash to generate an API, then eventually hid the keys in an .env file.
4. NAVIGATION KEYS - This was a bit of a problem since I haven't quite used it well but I believe that next time, it would not be much of a hassle.
5. RESOURCES - I used resources such as Youtube, W3Schools and solicited help from stack overflow at a point.
6. I'd also like some feedback on this please as I am well aware that my css is messed up but it wouldn't come back to normal no matter what I did.
